# udacity-self-driving-car
This is a machine learning project, in which a car is driven autonomously in a simulator using a nine-layered convolutional neural network. The simulator used in the video is Udacity's open source simulator. 


### Prerequisites

You'll require the following packages to run this on you own machine. 
## libraries

* [Tensorflow-gpu](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) - Deep learning library used.
* [TFlearn](https://tflearn.org/) - Higher level wrapper on tensorflow.
* you only need to install tensoflow by your self. Others can be isntalled using requirements.txt, follow the instructions in installing section 

### Installing
* clone this repository.
* [Tensorflow-gpu](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) - Install tensorflow gpu from this link (you will need a nvidia graphic card)
* use the following command to install other dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

if it fails you can install the following libraries using pip directly. (if you get stuck somewhere doing this, just google it)
```

```

## Running the tests
To check the installation of the libraries you can import them in your python terminal. 
(mostly everything except tensorflow and opencv should work without any problems)

## How to train your own neural network

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [ROME](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Used to generate RSS Feeds
